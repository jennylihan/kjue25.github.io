					<h3>Challenges</h3>
					<strong>Presenting a Sensitive Topic While Avoiding Judgment</strong>
					<p>Throughout our process, we frequently considered how our experience would make users feel. While we wanted to inspire a greater awareness of how choices affect equity and encourage more equitable school choices, we did not want to impose guilt on our users because we believe that guilt would cause our users to shut down, rather than productively engaging with the conflicts we present. This is a tricky balance to achieve, and we attempted to do so by:
					<div style="padding-left:20px; padding-right:40px">
						<ul class="text-left">
							<li>Intentionally choosing colors that would not impart judgment (i.e. not green or red, which may have cultural affordances for right/wrong) and using neutral colors to highlight value vs. choice mismatches.</li>
							<li>Making it inevitable to have conflicting values and choices because no school is perfect; explicitly discussing the difficulty of choosing a school that aligns with all of one's values.</li>
							<li>Including research to support summary content, and presenting it in a conversational manner that acknowledges the nuance of equity as a reason for difficulty in decision-making (i.e., “balancing these issues of equity can be difficult”).</li>
						</ul> 
					</div>
					</p>

					<strong>Determining Audience to Inform Goal of Experience</strong>
					<p>Many users who tested our prototype had not yet begun thinking about school choice, and were both surprised and inspired by the issues of educational equity. However, some of our test users who were already thinking about school choice felt that our experience lacked actionable information which they could use to make more equitable school choices. This represents a tension between our target audience; with further user testing, we would attempt to clarify who this experience could be most impactful for and determine how actionable information could be presented without alienating or overwhelming less informed users. </p>

					<h3>Future Work</h3>
					<strong>Prioritizing School Properties</strong>
					<p>We are still considering getting users to prioritize the school properties they choose by dragging and dropping the rows in the school choice table. This would allow us to better understand what they users were prioritizing to show them more relevant content and to show aggregate data about what all users have prioritized. Additionally, some test users have suggested that this would help them make a decision about which school to choose. </p>

					<strong>Rethinking Presentation of School Data</strong>
					<p>We have consistently gotten feedback that the table of school choices is overwhelming. While we want this choice to be difficult and overwhelming to some degree, in order to reflect the difficult and overwhelming nature of the actual choice, it should not inhibit users from completing the experience. Moving forward, we would test new ways of presenting the information, such as a more visually appealing and digestible format which used simple graphics to convey basic elements of school properties and hover test which goes into greater detail about the school property. Additionally, we are considering structuring this in more of a “report card” format with each school getting a more visually distinct section of the page with more formatting to distinguish property categories and the properties themselves. </p>

					<strong>Providing Real and Geographically Relevant School Property Data and Analysis</strong>
					<p>Another piece of feedback we received was to utilize real school data chosen by the user or collected from the user’s local areas rather than realistic but fictional school data. If we were to choose the goal of helping young parents make school choices, this would help make the experience more realistic and actionable. However, school comparison products like this already exist and it is unclear if an equity focused comparison could compete with these other tools. Additionally, with real schools we risk make the experience too real and falling into the “guilt-imposing” trap we have worked to avoid. Thus, this expansion would require us to do even more work to ensure that we are inspiring the appropriate feelings in our users and that we are accurately and fairly representing the real schools. </p>

					<h4>About the Project</h4>
					<p>For our CS377I course (Designing Systems for Humans) in Spring 2018, we created an explorable explanation about issues in education to promote reflection and awareness of potential misalignment between one’s values and decisions, as they relate to equity. Check out the project <a href="https://kjue25.github.io/education-equity.html">here</a>.</p>
