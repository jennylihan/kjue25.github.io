        <h1>GABI'S ART CARD!</h1>
        <h3>By: Gabi R.</h3>
        
        <p> 
            I really enjoyed the process of creating this art card,
           one of my favorite parts of it was that if I made a
           "mistake" or I did something to the drawing that I
           maybe didn't like to much, I couldn't go back and
           fix it because we were instructed to use black pen only.
           I just had to accept that it was okay or I could find
           a way to fix it so that I liked it better. The process of the actual design wasn't too interesting,
           my original idea was to make an abstract portrait:

            I wasn't to fond of the idea so I kept on brainstorming,
           I made little doodles and tried to think of anything. The idea 
           of my finished product kind of just came out of nowhere. I don't relly know 
           where I got my  inspiration but bassicly I drew a big eye in the middle of the paper

            Even though the design is pretty simple and it doesn't have
           much details, I enjoyed coloring in the empty spaces.
           It was pretty relaxing (although the sharpie fumes were
            pretty bad). Overall the process/unit of the art card was
            pretty fun! :)
