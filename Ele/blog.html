        <h5>From the Society of Telekenisis</h5>
            <p>Welcome to the Academy of the Gifted, a school designed to nourish those with the ancient power of Telekenisis. If you have made it to this page then you have passed the test.</p>
        <h3>A Brief History of the Power of Telekanisis</h3>
        <p>     2000 years ago the human race went extinct except for a few gifted beings. These people had the power of telekenisis. Humans first developed this strange power around the 1930s. This led to the real reason there was WW2, people learning the power of telekenisis and using it aggainst otheres. Then in 2020 a virus spred across the earth causing humans to be unpreapared for the coming events.
            It is not entirely clear what happed but we know there were numuros threats getting progresivly more violent until yellowstone erupted. This eruption destroyed much of what used to be a continent called North America. The smoke cloud created from the explosion was so large it blocked the sunlight of most of the world, killing plants and destroying food chains and ecosystems.
            Humans were amongst the few species to survive but just barely. Most other forms of life were bacteria that could survive in extreame conditions. The remaning humans pased dow the power of telekenisis making a much stronger and more powerful human race. Telekinisis is genetic so if any of your ancesetors possed this power the there is a chance that you to could have.
            As the world eventualy became more haspitable to life humans expanded scociety. In scociety those with the power of telekenisis were known all across the the world. They where the ones with the power. Then in 3,147 a man called Robert Londols who was elected as president of th Union of Telikinetics. Robert was an ecpecialy powerful at a telikenisis. Un fortunatly that power was too much for him and he eventualy decided to take over the world.
        It is not clear how he was stopped but somehow the world was saved from him. Science then people with the power of telekinisis have been band from using this rare power by the public. That same year the Acadamy of the Gifted opend.</p>
