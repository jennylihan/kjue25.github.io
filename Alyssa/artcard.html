        <h1> My Art Card </h1>
        <h2> By: Alyssa K. </h2>

        <p>
            
            In fourth grade, my friend and I would always draw on our hands with washable markers, and at the time I had never heard of a Zentangle.
            <br>
            Last year, one of the units in Art class was about zentangles, and I had a lot of fun with that.
            <br>
            I now look back and realize that we were doing the same thing in 4th grade without realizing it.
            <br>
            <br>
            I worked on this art card in art class, and it took about an hour and a half, and this is how it has turned out: 
            <br>
            <img src="AlyArt.png" alt="" class="center" width="333px"/>
        </p>

        <p> 
            Last year, I made a different art card, and if you buy them, they get shrunk down to Â¼ of the original size, so here is what my first art card looks like: 
            <br>
            <img src="ArtCard6.jpg" alt="" class="center" width="333px"/>

        </p>

        <p>
            I am excited to see the final product, when shrunk down, and I am happy with the result I got.
