            How to make an art card.
        </h2>
        <p>
            I have am making this website to show an example on how to make an art
            card. There are numbered steps below on how to make your art card.
        </p>
        <p>
            1: First off you are going to need to come up with an idea for your art 
            card. You cannot use any sort of copy right material such as characters 
            from different shows that you have watched. It has to be original so that
            there are not any sort of legal problems when it gets sent off to print.

            2: Materials. To do anything to your art card you are going to need tools
            as well as supplies. The supplies that are needed for you to make your 
            art card are an artista fine liner, a peice of paper for sketch, the 
            sheet and formating for the art card sent to you by Nori, and a pencil,
            which is about it. If you need an example these materials here are 
            some images below to reference.

        <p>
            Next, you are going to want to sketch out a design for your card in pencil.
            You dont really hve yo but there can never be any pencil on the final thing 
            becasue then it will screw up the whole process an your card will not work 
            out. I also traced the lining of the cards border to actually be able to use 
            the sketch. Here is a picture of my sketch so that you can have an example.

        <p>
            Once you have your sketch you will need to trace it onto the art card format
            that has been given to you by mail. To trace this you will have to secure the 
            sketch in place with tape and then you can use a light underneath the two 
            papers to be able to see the sketch and then you can use your artista pen to
            trace the sketch. You will have the art card format on top and then have the 
            sketch underneath and a light underneath that to be able to see the sketch 
            better through the paper. Make sure to not make the lines to thin or else
            it wont show up on your final product. A fourth of the art card format 
            will be the size of the final art card.

        <p>
            Above is the lining that I did for my art card format. The next step for this
            process is to write your name on this as well as your class number as well. 
            YOu are goin got want to leave the printer number blank becuase that is 
            for teh printing company to edit. For your name box in the middle of the 
            bottom of the page you are going to want to write down your name. You have to
            put down your full name but you can put it in paraenthesis so that it 
            doeasn't show up on the final card. You can use this and write a nick name on 
            the card instead too! You can also put down a title but you don't have too 
            if you don't want a title on your final art card. For your class number I 
            beleive that you put down your class number whether that be your grade or
            section you can ask your teacher.
        </p>
            Once you have checked with your teacher that your art card is good to go to the 
            printers, you are going to have to get out a large envelope and address it to mailing
            address in the instructions.
            <p>
            You are going to want to put this address in the center of your envelope and then 
            you are goog to want to put your address in the left hand corner I think. Next you
            are going to put the art card format inside of the envelope and then send it
            off to the printers by mail. That is how you make your an art card.
