        <h3>Awareness</h3>
         <p>
            There has been many cruel acts against these creatures and it is not right.
            This elephant was pregnant, harmed, and unprotected. Some cruel people did
            the wrong thing, to feed a elephant firecrackers. This elephant died, sadly,
            and it shows how cruel hummanity can be. Thankfully some people helped and tried
            their best to help the poor elephant but she unfortunately died. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EcZsuq7MoE">This is the link</a>
            to a video informing you more about the cruel act.
