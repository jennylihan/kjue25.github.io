            The Death Cap Mushroom, or <i>Amanita phalloides</i>, is one of the most poisonous mushrooms in the world.
            Consuming even half a mushroom could lead to certain death, unless brought to a hospital immediately.

            Recent History in California
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Death Cap Mushroom first started to become a real threat in November 2016 when a group of fungus hunters found a large bloom of Death Cap mushrooms in the San Francisco bay area. Over the course of several weeks, doctors had treated 14 people who had become very sick due to consuming the mushroom. Before this outbreak, there were typically only a few cases of mushroom poisoning a year, so this unexpected sudden outbreak frightened Medical officials.
