<h2>Hi there!</h2>
<p>
Hi there!
Hi there! I’m Blobber. I’m a frog. It’s actually pretty easy. 
You wake up, you eat, you avoid getting eaten by predators. 
The rest of your time is dedicated to artistic values. Some 
frogs paint, some sculpt, some dance, some write, and some do 
everything! I’m one of the everything frogs. I wake up, eat, 
avoid predators and do art! Boom! The life of a frog. It’s pretty 
fun. And my art is pretty good.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Frog_Prince">Here's a 
    link to the famous most famous frog's work!</a> </p>
<p>I think I’m going to share with you some poetry. Ahem...</p>
<h2>My poetry</h2>
<h3>Wake up!</h3>
<p>
I'm a frog, you're a frog
We're a frog. We're sleeping!
Time to wake up,
Don't get eaten, now let's play!
Yay!
</p> <p>
    Wasn't that something? How about another one?</p>
<h3>Flies and fish</h3>
<p>
I have a lovely tounge
It can catch flies!
Have you ever seen a fish do that?
I am not very slimey, I can jump
Fish can't do that.
Therefor, I am better than a Fish
</p>
<p>
     Now that one was outstanding, shall we try again?
</p>
<h3>A park</h3>
<p>
Wouldn't it be nice to have my
very own park?
To play, to jump,
to swim and make friends?
Oh wouldn't it be nice to have a park?
A frog park...
</p>

<h2>My routine</h2>
<p>
 I thought it would be fun to share with you my diet.
 Some people just assume I eat only flies! It's not true!
 I eat plenty of other things! Here's my daily menu:

<p>
Okay fine! My diet consists of nothing other than flies,
algae, and moss! Don't ask!
</p><p>
The rest of it is just pretty awesome art. 
</p>
<p>
Also, I need some help. What do you think about my business idea?
