        Olaf the doggo
        </h1>
        <p> 
        Olaf is a japanese spitz doggo. He ate all of his "durable" stuffed animals, so now he only gets toys that he can eat.
        He also likes to run at the chickens and pretend that he is going to eat them, but after the chickens bite his nose, he is more careful.  Before we got chickens he would never 
        eat vegetables, but now he'll do tricks for veggies.  He also started scratching and biting at the ground with them.
       We bath him about every month so he doesnt get dirty. His favorite beach is carmel and he also likes to go to tahoe. When he is not on a walk or eating, you can find hime sleeping on the bed.
