    <h4>hedgehogs as pets: </h4>
    <p>hedgehogs are common pets in many areas. 
    the care involved is similar to a hamster because 
    they need a cage and hamsters and hedgehogs are 
    close in size. Although they are fun pets to have, 
    they are not legal in many states in the US (california, georgia, 
    hawaii, etc.), and in some other states they are legal but you 
    need a permit to own one as a pet (arizna, maine, wyoming, etc.) <h4>
