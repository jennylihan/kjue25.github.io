        <h2>What Is An Art Card?</h2>

        <p>
                
            Every year at GMS all the sixth seventh and eighth graders make art cards. All the students draw whatever they 
            want on a special piece of paper and then GMS sends them to a GMS family to print.The family then shrinks the 
            picture so its about a fourth of the size before, and prints out hundreds of art cards out. 
            After they are printed, GMS sells them to raise money so that we can get more art supplies every year.

        <h2>Starting My Art Card</h2>
        <p>
            When I started I knew I wanted to include different types of plants, so I satrted drawing random plants and 
            tried to figure out which ones I liked. After I figured out some plants that I liked I tried to narrow it down 
            to choosing five plants. Then I dicided it would be cool to draw the plants like they were lined up on the floor.
            I was drawing the plants when I relized that once I drew the five plants and it was shrunken You wouldent be 
            able to see the plants really well. So, to fix this I took away one of the plants so then I had four plants.

        <h2>Finishing My Art Card</h2>
            <p>
                
                Once I figured out how I wanted my art card to look, in sharpie I drew out my final picture. Once I finished I 
                mailed it to the printers house.
