      <h2> Intro </h2>
   <h3> Hi, my name is Sophia I am the founder and CEO of Zazu Tutoring.
        I started this company in May 2020 at the age of 12. At Zazu we are always working 
    on making learning enjoyable by doing custume lessons that last 20 minutes for kids ages 2-5 . </h3>

    <h2> Behind The Idea </h2>
     <h3> As a little kid I got to learn about whatever I wanted, but as I got older and started school
      I had to learn the curiculum of course. This was deffenitly not as enjoyalble for me and I really wanted to learn
      about certain things that interested me. I started to offer babysitting but then the pandemic hit. Thats were the idea of Zazu came along. I always want kids to be 
      able to learn about whatever they want with a twist of curiculum included. 
    </h3>
