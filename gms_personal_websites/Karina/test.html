    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Like other salamanders, Axolotl have the ability to regrow body organs, lost limbs, even the spinal cord! Every time one part gets detached or crushed, a replacement will grow perfectly. However, axolotl can only regrow the same limb about five times. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Male axolotls have wide heads and no eyelids, unlike the female axolotl.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>The breeding process for axolotl is a walz.</li>
        <br>
        <li>A mythological connector to the Axolotl is Xolotl, a dog-headed Aztec God. In the stories, Xolotl was scared of being sacrificed to the sun as Aztec gods had to do, and transformed into an Axolotl to hide.</li> 
        <br>
        <li> Axolotl's closest relative is a tiger salamander.</li>
        <br>
        <li> As soon as Axolotl are hatched, they have no parenting, and are independant.</li>
        <br>
        <li> Axolotls live in Mexico, and were once eaten for nutrition. However, it is now a popular pet to have in Japan. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Toothless from How to Train Your Dragon was inspired to look like an Axolotl.</li> 
        <br>
        <li>There are about 700 to 1,200 axolotls left in the wild due to habitat loss. By donating to charities, scientists will breed more axolotl to prevent it from going extinct.</li>
