    <p>Throughout the process of making this art card I faced many challenges, but I kept perservering and eventually overcame the challenges. It was a long and difficult process, but I definitely had fun and am happy with the results. <a href="https://zentangle.com/">Here is some inpiration for zentangles too!</a></p>

    <h3>Here is my Process:</h3>
    <p>I started by brainstorming cool and unique ideas, and eventually I came up with a crystal fox. Now you may be wondering what is a crystal fox, and at that time I couldn't really tell you. I wanted something geometrical and cool, but I couldn't figure out how I would pull it off, so I started by planning and drafting. And I did a lot of practice.</p>

    <p>After I found a design I liked, I started to shade, practice, and trace to make sure I would end up with the design I wanted. I wanted something cool and unique that would set me apart from the other art cards.</p>

    <p>Finally I started to put my final Art card together. I only had one shot so I was nervous to start, but soon I started to get the hang of it. This is when I ran into a challenge. I realized that my fox design was to small for the art card, but I didn't want to redraw it so I had to make it work. I decided that I could use the extra space for leaves and berries to add an extra factor to the drawing, so that is exactly what I did. I traced and drew, making all sorts of lines and dots. Finally I ended up with this...</p>

    <p>When I look back at this drawing, there are many things I would of liked to improve, but overall, I am happy and satisfyed with my results. I am proud to say that I overcame many challenges throughout this process, but I had a lot of fun using my creativity and creating this "masterpiece". If I had more time, I might add more detail, but for now I think I'm good. I faced challenges due to time and much more, but finally I finished, which felt like forever. I hope you enjoyed reading about my process, because I definetely enjoyed creating it. Hope to see you again soon!</p>
