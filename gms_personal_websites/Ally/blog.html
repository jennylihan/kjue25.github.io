         Animals make life interesting. In a way, there are some difficult things that you need
         to do when having an animal like a dog or 
         cat. You need to be responsible to take care of it. 
         Of course, most people use online sources or go to the vet in times when they are sick, need shots, etc.
         But, for me its much 
         easier to use online sources because of the time it takes to go to the vet!
