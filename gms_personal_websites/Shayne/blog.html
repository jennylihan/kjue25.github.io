    <h4> About my art zentangle</h4>
    <p> This is my art card, my art card is a zentangle.  
            Drawing zentangles are used to relax and calm down. How you draw is by getting a sharpie and drawing doodles inside of lines.       </p> 
      <h5> Why I choose zentangle</h5>
    <p>
    They are very relaxing to draw. 
      They can help you calm down by drawing them and looking at them!
      I thought people would like getting a zentangle on their holliday cards or magnets.
