<h2> By Claire B.</h2>
<h1>Tip 1: get supplies</h1>
<p>

    Collect supplies! You will need:
    Non perishable food
    Drinking water
    Sleeping bag (or warm clothes)
    Weapons (long distance and for hand to hand combat, preferably silent)
    A backpack
    A flashlight with batteries
</p>
<h1>Tip 2: make a plan</h1>
<p>
    You will need a plan. Figure out a location that is remote enough that 
    people won't be flocking there, but not so remote that if you have to 
    start scavenging, you won't be able to find civilization.
</p>
<h1>Tip 3: destroy the brain</h1>
<p>
    To kill a zombie you need to destroy the brain, whether that be through 
    stabbing the head or just using a general firearm. After you kill it, 
    to dispose of the body you should probably burn it.
