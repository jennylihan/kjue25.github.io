            Mr. Dog is a 60 year old dog, with a monocle and one of those cute little zoom filter mustaches. Mr. Dog wakes up every morning and makes himself a cup of warm, not hot, coffee. He wakes up at exactly 8:11 a.m and eats a croissant for breakfast at 8:23 a.m. Somedays, he likes to go visit his friends, Mr. Rabbit and Ms. Squirrel.

            Mr. Dog always goes to see his friends at 3:12 everyday, after his lunch and afternoon nap. Mr. Rabbit and Ms. Squirrel have been friends with Mr. Dog ever since they were in preschool. They eat tea and crumpets together in the local park, and play with the little kids that come by.

            After meeting his friends, Mr. Dog goes home at 6:12 to eat dinner and go to bed after his nightly routine. He usually eats lasagna, and then takes a bath in his antique bath tub. He brushes his teeth, reads for 13 minutes, plays his white noise machine and then goes to bed.
