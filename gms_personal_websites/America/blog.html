Add eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition then scrape down the bowl. Add 2 tsp vanilla and beat to combine.

Reduce mixer speed to medium and add the flour mixture in thirds alternating with the buttermilk, mixing to incorporate with each addition. Scrape down the bowl as needed and beat until just combined and smooth. Divide the batter evenly into a 12-count lined muffin or cupcake pan, filling 2/3 full.

Bake for 20-23 minutes at 350 °F, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let them cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and cool to room temperature before frosting.</p>

        1 teaspoon baking powder❤️
        1 teaspoon fine sea salt❤️
        1 stick (113 grams) unsalted butter❤️
        3/4 cup (202 grams) creamy peanut butter (I used Skippy)❤️
        1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar❤️
        1 cup (200 grams) packed dark brown sugar❤️
        2 large eggs plus 1 egg yolk, at room temperature❤️

        2 cups (340 grams) semi sweet chocolate chips❤️</p>


        <p>1. Melt the butter in bowl
           2.Combine PB in hot butter 
        </p>In a large heat safe bowl, microwave the butter until melted. Vigorously stir in the peanut butter into the hot butter until well combined. Stir in the granulated sugar and brown sugar until well combined. Add the eggs and yolk, one at a time, stirring well after each addition. Add in the vanilla. Gradually stir in the flour mixture. Stir in the chocolate chips. Dough may be a little loose and slightly crumbly.

        OPTIONAL: If time permits, cover the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours but no more than 72 hours. Let the dough sit at room temperature just until it is soft enough to scoop. 
        
        Divide the dough into 3-tablespoon sized balls using a spring-loaded scoop and drop onto prepared baking sheets. Flatten dough slightly into disc shapes with your palms. Dot each disc with a few extra chocolate chips for picture-perfect cookies.
        
        Bake for 12 minutes, or until golden brown. Let cool for 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.</p>
