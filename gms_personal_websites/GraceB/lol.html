            <h2>Lola</h2>
            <p id="p2">
            Lola is one of the craziest dogs you will ever meet. When she goes on walks, she pulls on the leash as if she is the mighty thor of doggos, but when she gets home, she will sunggle up on a couch pillow compleatly submerged for hours at a time. You can often find a toy in her bed that she has bit many times where the squeeker is. Sometimes when she is board, she will squeek a toy for five minuets streight! She wears a leather mint green color and purple harness. Here eyes are ginormous
            and she has a little white tip on her tail. Lola is the smallest being in the household. Her ears tend to be eratic and they are rarley symetrical. She ADORES belly rubs and is super snuggley.
            However, dispite her lazyness, she is EXTREAMLY fast and can jump VERY high. You should see her when a squirl goes by! She barks at any dog she sees, unless she souronded by them, which has only happened twice when we went to a very dog filled beach. 
            She does this thing where she spreads her legs to the side so they look like chicken thighs. Watch the video below and you'll see what I mean.Lola Bola is the warm little beam of happienes and hope that we all need.

        <h2>Tucker</h2>
          Tucker is our little baby dee (we call him tuckidee). He is the kind of dog who will protect his humans no matter what. If i so much as touch my mom's arm, 
          he will bark at me for showing a sign of possible violence. He also is the kind of dog who will lick you like its the last day until the sun explodes. 
          Sometimes he even will lick up your nose, and sometimes if your luck, he'll hug you and give you licks. When he wants belly rubs and he is on the couch,
          he will sit up as if he is a human and expose his belly to all the rubs. Its is one of the MOST adoribal things EVER. He is 13 pounds, which is big compared to lola, who weighs 8 lbs.
          Tucker is also refered to as the chunckinator, becuase of his head to ribcage racio (his ribcage is very big). He also likes to borrow in the blanktes, just like lola. He communicates with us everytime he thinks something is wrong, like if he hasent been on a walk in the past 5 hours, or if he wants his dinner. Tucker doesnt like to sit on the hardwood floor or the stone outside, so if he can, he will sit on something soft, like a blanket, doormat or towl. Tucker is our litte protector in shining fur.

             <p>At first we had no idea what breed they are, and the only thing we knew was that they had some chihuahua in them. But, recently, I have made the discovery that they are Grayhound Chihuahuas! (Grayhuahuas).</p>
