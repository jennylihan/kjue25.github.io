        <h2>Why Jaguars are so Important</h2>
        <p>
            "Jaguars are the top predators in their environment, 
            so they play an important role in controlling the populations of other species. 
            This helps keep a balance in the food chain, and a healthy environment.
            By protecting jaguars and the places where they live, we’re also helping 
            to look after other wildlife – of which there are a lot of in the Amazon and Pantanal – 
            as well as the people who live and work around there." (Credit: <a href="https://www.wwf.org.uk/learn/wildlife/jaguars" target="_blank" </a> wwf.org</a>)
