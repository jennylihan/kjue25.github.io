      <h1>The Journey of my Art Card</h1>
      <h2>By:Bhavya</h2>
      <p>
         When I started making my art card I was judt using the method of "go with the flow" 
         and in the beginning I did not think it looked to bad, but once I continued to go on, I fet that it just 
         got worse and worse. Below is a picture of what it looked like.Press this 
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcGr3FeSx-4">link</a> to see another form of go with the flow art.

         I started to try to make myself feel better by telling myself to think of it as a 
         representation of the North Star. I actually liked the idea in the beginning, but it lost its special 
         feeling after a few minutes. So I immediatly started my next art card to be able to finish in time. I looked for a 
         little bit of insparation, and then it hit me lit 500 bricks! I realized that I should make an empty space art, that 
         was made by being surrounded with zentangles. Below is a picture

         If you were not able to tell which out of the two cards I liked better, it was the bear. 
         I was pretty proud of it and thought that even though it was a little messy, when it shrinks, 
         it will look cleaner.
