        <h2>Zoe's Art Card</h2>
        <h3>By Zoe</h3>
        <p> 
            Art cards are sometimes made in color, while others are just in plain Black and White.
             This is the Black and White zentangle I did:
        </p>
        <img src="BlogImage.jpg" width= 300px/>
        <p> 
            I was inspired by flowers, which is why there is a kind of flower vibe.

        </p>
        <p> 
            Zentangles can be animals, people, objects, flowers, and more. 
            Zentangle is a good way to just calm yourself. 
            It helps sooth your brain after an intense day at work or school.
             I highly suggest to start doing zentangles for fun if you are highly stressed a lot. 
             Zentangles are a good way to use your free time because there is no limit to what you can make.
