        <p>
                I live with my human family (Peggy, Ben, Sawyer, Penelope) 
                My favorite food is chicken but I don't like tuna. I am a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Blue>Russian Blue</a> cat.
                My favorite toy to attack is a fuzzy ball. I like sleeping with a dog toy. 
                My favorite cat tv show is looking out the window at trees. 
                My talents are sleeping, playing, and meowing.
