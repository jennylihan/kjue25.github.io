        <h1>A Day in the Life of Wesley Swipes</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Wesley Swipes, but you can call me Wesley. Here is a photo
            of me: <img src="Wesley_looking_up-1.jpg">
            
            I live with my human family (Peggy, Ben, Sawyer, Penelope) My favorite food is chicken but I don't like tuna.
            My favorite toy to attack is a fuzzy ball. I like sleeping with a dog toy. 
            My favorite cat tv show is looking out the window at trees. My talents are sleeping, playing, and meowing
