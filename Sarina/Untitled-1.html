<h2>Hi there!</h2>

Hi there!
Hi there! I’m Blobber. I’m a frog. It’s actually pretty easy. 
You wake up, you eat, you avoid getting eaten by predators. 
The rest of your time is dedicated to artistic values. Some 
frogs paint, some sculpt, some dance, some write, and some do 
everything! I’m one of the everything frogs. I wake up, eat, 
avoid predators and do art! Boom! The life of a frog. It’s pretty 
fun. And my art is pretty good. Now, why don't you take a look
 at my work by clicking aroung the top menu

<h2>My poetry</h2>
<h3>Wake up!</h3>
<p>
I'm a frog, you're a frog
We're a frog. We're sleeping!
Time to wake up,
Don't get eaten, now let's play!
Yay!
</p> <p>
    Wasn't that something? How about another one?</p>
<h3>Flies and fish</h3>
<p>
I have a lovely tounge
It can catch flies!
Have you ever seen a fish do that?
I am not very slimey, I can jump
Fish can't do that.
Therefor, I am better than a Fish
</p>
<p>
Now that one was outstanding, shall we try again?
</p>
<h3>A park</h3>
<p>
Wouldn't it be nice to have my
very own park?
To play, to jump,
to swim and make friends?
Oh wouldn't it be nice to have a park?
A frog park...
