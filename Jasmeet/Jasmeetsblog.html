<h1>Dakota Singh</h1>
Dakota is a german sheperd dog. she is a mix of a tan, black, brown and white.
she knows how to walk on the treadmil thanks to Jasmeet. Dakota loves to go outside
she also loves to bother our cats (gigi and rin). she also loves to bother our bird
(roshni). 
Dakota is one years old and loves to eat HUMAN foods! for some reason dakota
still loves to bite everyone. also when I am in school she is usually on my bed sleeping
