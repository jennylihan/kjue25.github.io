        <h4>Why I think corgis are the superior animal</h4>
        <p>Three years ago my life changed, I GOT A CORGI!!!! As soon as we met Charlotte (my corgi) we knew that she would be the best dog our family had every had. She is so playful and although she likes to sleep a lot she also loves to play with us, and always makes us laugh. Here is just one of the many supper cute photos we have of Charlotte. </p>
