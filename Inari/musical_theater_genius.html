            <h2>Top 15 Highest Grossing Musicals So Far<h2> 
            <h5>*Note: This is decided based on the Gross Revenue, how much money they earned from tickets.
               Just because the musicals are the highest grossing doesn't mean there aren't musicals that are better.
               It is subjective.</h5>

            <p>If you don't know, Hamilton is about Alexander Hamilton from American History
               and put into a musical! The whole thing is all songs, no dialogue except in the middle
               of a song. </p>
            <p>The soundtrack is amazing and most of it is historically accurate! I would've never thought
               to make a musical about American history! You can learn a lot from Hamilton too. </p>
            <p> Like I said, it follows Alexander Hamilton from the start of the American revoloution
               to his death. Aaron Burr is also a main character, and you see a lot of others too! </p>
            <h3>Fun Facts:</h3>
               <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLJj5ohEcQo">Bullet Character</a>
            <li>Watch this video explaining "The Bullet". If you don't want to, here is a short summary:
               Basically there is this special ensemble member who appears right before someone dies. They
               foreshadow someone's death.</li>
               <li>Alexander Hamilton (in the show) walks in curves and Burr walks in straight lines. 
               Why is this? You tell me. </li>
               <li>You know how the stage turns? Well, in each scene when it turns, it means something. If the 
               turn tables turn left, it is going backwards in time. When it goes right, it is moving
               forwards. </li>

            <p>Alright, here is the plot of Dear Evan Hansen. I'll try my very best,
               but Wikipedia might explain it better... Okay, so basically we have
               Evan Hansen who has social anxiety. He decides to write letters to himself, 
               saying one good thing about today. So he writes one of these letters about Zoe, 
               a girl he has a crush on. Zoe's brother sees this note and thinks its for him to read
               to make fun of him. He then commits suicide, and Evan Hansen lies, saying they
               were friends. He comes up with this project in honor Zoe's brother, Connor's, death. 
               Anyway, here is the link to Wikipedia's plot thingy. It will make a lot more sense.
