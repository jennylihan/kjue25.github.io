					<h3>Pivoting to an explorable on school choice</h3>
					<p>In thinking about and researching the system of school choice, we came to the conclusion that inequities exist in the system largely because of a conflict in personal values and values for and ideal society. In conjunction with a feeling of personal insignificance within the context of a large system, this discrepancy allows people to make decisions which negatively impact society as a whole while feeling satisfied with their decision due to a lack of awareness of their impact.</p>

					<p>As such, in explaining this system (and specifically the agency users have in the system), we decided that is was essential to juxtapose the personal and societal to elucidate the cognitive dissonance people experience when making school choices.</p>

					<p>To do this, we were inspired by Nicky Case’s explorable explanations like the “Parable of the Polygons” which ask users to take agency for choices and then explain the impacts of those choices.</p>

					<p>This led us to our current design of explore explanation which exists in three main parts:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The selection of value statements around equity in the general education system under a “veil of ignorance”</li>
						<li>The selection of a school as a personal choice</li>
						<li>The summary in which we present conflict between the user’s equitable values for society and their personal school decision</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The idea of the “veil of ignorance” came from initially testing an early prototype with fewer value statements and more basic school choices during an in-class gallery walk.  A test user mentioned that our experience seemed like it was utilizing the veil of ignorance.</p>

					<p>This concept comes from a thought experience proposed by John Rawls where people determine principles for distribution of rights, positions, and resources in society without knowing their position in society. This is meant to inspire people to make decisions based on moral considerations rather than personal or class considerations.</p>

					<p>By dividing our experience into the first two parts, a value-based judgement and a personal judgement, we are initially placing the user behind the veil of ignorance (“Please choose the option that best matches your values for the education system”).  We then remove the veil by asking the user to make choices that will affect a fictional but deeply personal child.  These last part of our explorable is meant to expose the conflict between moral values and personal values which people have when navigating the education system.</p>

					<h3>Initial design from gallery walkthrough feedback</h3>
					<p>Once we decided to move forward with a focus on how school choice affects equity in education, we knew we wanted quality of content to be our primary focus.  Given the three parts of our explorable, we started by <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eoc3T_qwvYNG0jKgPkWm62D5tyeXYCm3S3e3CF3s1MQ/edit?usp=sharing">mapping out</a> different equity categories in education and how they related to the value statements in the first half of the prototype and the school properties in the second half.  We charted potential results that users would see using several tables to ensure balance across the school options.</p>

					<p>Through early feedback from the in-class gallery walk, several testers reported feeling “judged” when choosing particular value statements.  Our goal was not to change behavior or provoke feelings of guilt – and certainly not to push the user away.  Therefore, we rephrased several value statements in the first half of the prototype to prevent implying an explicit “good” or “bad” answer and abstracted them such that each began with “I believe” and none had the user as the subject in the clause that followed.  In the summary and conclusion, we also acknowledge why people may make inequitable personal decisions and discuss multiple perspectives on equity issues to indicate their complexity.  Lastly, we decided to only show summary content only if the user valued equity in a particular category and the user chose a school that was inequitable in that category; we chose not to point out where the user’s selected values were inequitable.</p>

					<p>Moving into more explicit planning and testing of content, our goal through these three adjustments was to move from a user experience of “I feel judged for making these decisions” to “I realize that these are difficult decisions with real-world tradeoffs.”</p>

					<h4>About the Project</h4>
					<p>For our CS377I course (Designing Systems for Humans) in Spring 2018, we created an explorable explanation about issues in education to promote reflection and awareness of potential misalignment between one’s values and decisions, as they relate to equity. Check out the project <a href="https://kjue25.github.io/education-equity.html">here</a>.</p>
