					<h3>Pivoting to an explorable on school choice</h3>
					<p>In thinking about and researching the system of school choice, we came to the conclusion that inequities exist in the system largely because of a conflict in personal values and values for and ideal society. In conjunction with a feeling of personal insignificance within the context of a large system, this discrepancy allows people to make decisions which negatively impact society as a whole while feeling satisfied with their decision due to a lack of awareness of their impact.</p>

					<p>As such, in explaining this system (and specifically the agency users have in the system), we decided that is was essential to juxtapose the personal and societal to elucidate the cognitive dissonance people experience when making school choices.</p>

					<p>To do this, we were inspired by Nicky Case’s explorable explanations like the “Parable of the Polygons” which ask users to take agency for choices and then explain the impacts of those choices.</p>

					<p>This led us to our current design of explore explanation which exists in three main parts:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The selection of value statements around equity in the general education system under a “veil of ignorance”</li>
						<li>The selection of a school as a personal choice</li>
						<li>The summary in which we present conflict between the user’s equitable values for society and their personal school decision</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The idea of the “veil of ignorance” came from initially testing an early prototype with fewer value statements and more basic school choices during an in-class gallery walk.  A test user mentioned that our experience seemed like it was utilizing the veil of ignorance.</p>

					<p>This concept comes from a thought experience proposed by John Rawls where people determine principles for distribution of rights, positions, and resources in society without knowing their position in society. This is meant to inspire people to make decisions based on moral considerations rather than personal or class considerations.</p>

					<p>By dividing our experience into the first two parts, a value-based judgement and a personal judgement, we are initially placing the user behind the veil of ignorance (“Please choose the option that best matches your values for the education system”).  We then remove the veil by asking the user to make choices that will affect a fictional but deeply personal child.  These last part of our explorable is meant to expose the conflict between moral values and personal values which people have when navigating the education system.</p>

					<h3>Initial design from gallery walkthrough feedback</h3>
					<p>Once we decided to move forward with a focus on how school choice affects equity in education, we knew we wanted quality of content to be our primary focus.  Given the three parts of our explorable, we started by <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eoc3T_qwvYNG0jKgPkWm62D5tyeXYCm3S3e3CF3s1MQ/edit?usp=sharing">mapping out</a> different equity categories in education and how they related to the value statements in the first half of the prototype and the school properties in the second half.  We charted potential results that users would see using several tables to ensure balance across the school options.</p>

					<p>Through early feedback from the in-class gallery walk, several testers reported feeling “judged” when choosing particular value statements.  Our goal was not to change behavior or provoke feelings of guilt – and certainly not to push the user away.  Therefore, we rephrased several value statements in the first half of the prototype to prevent implying an explicit “good” or “bad” answer and abstracted them such that each began with “I believe” and none had the user as the subject in the clause that followed.  In the summary and conclusion, we also acknowledge why people may make inequitable personal decisions and discuss multiple perspectives on equity issues to indicate their complexity.  Lastly, we decided to only show summary content only if the user valued equity in a particular category and the user chose a school that was inequitable in that category; we chose not to point out where the user’s selected values were inequitable.</p>

					<p>Moving into more explicit planning and testing of content, our goal through these three adjustments was to move from a user experience of “I feel judged for making these decisions” to “I realize that these are difficult decisions with real-world tradeoffs.”</p>

					<h3>Early content iteration and decisions</h3>

					<p>As a result of our focus on content quality, we decided to ask teachers specifically for feedback during our initial user tests since they would have the most domain-specific knowledge.  We also chose to use a Rapid Iteration Testing and Evaluation (RITE) format for our tests so that we would continually adjust language choices with each new test.  This allowed us to really fine-tune the content, even before we had finalized what we wanted the summary and conclusion portion of our prototype (what appears after you’ve selected a school) to look like.<p>

					<p>We interviewed <b>three teachers</b> with two primary sets of questions in mind:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Do the decisions we’re asking you to make – both in the value statements and in school choice – feel realistic?  Do they reflect school environments that you’ve seen in your experience as a teacher?</li>
						<li>Do the mappings of value statements to school properties to equity categories make sense?  Do the value statements align with the school properties that they would actually affect in an equity context?</li>
					</ul>
					<p>During these interviews, we used a Google slides prototype to test the value statements and school choice sections of our explorable.  At the end of the demo, we walked through the table mappings that would indicate misalignments between a user’s equity values and school choice to understand if the pairings made sense.</p>

					<p>These interviews prompted several small, iterative language tweaks to ensure that the value statements were parallel and that they reflected realistic binary equity tradeoffs that aligned with school properties.  For example, in the seventh set of statements we present to the user around racial integration policy, a teacher suggested making policymakers the subject of the clause instead of schools since schools are not legally allowed to impose racial quotas.</p>

					<p>In addition to these language adjustments, testing with teachers also prompted two major content design decisions:</p>

					<strong>1. Choosing schools vs. ranking school properties</strong>
					<p>We originally considered multiple options for the school selection part of the prototype, including building your own school and selecting values for school properties so that we could better analyze why users made their decision.  Initially, we settled on asking users to rank school properties after choosing a school in order to have them reflect on why they made their decisions.  This format also maintained the real-world aspect of constraining school choice, and we hoped to try to use the ranking information to better inform the final summary portion of our explorable.</p>

					<p>However, in our first teacher interview, we learned that when people rank their properties, their rankings don’t necessarily tell you about their true priorities.  In fact, their rankings are extremely context-specific – this teacher explained that in real life she would never live in a neighborhood with low test scores in the first place, but given the three school choices, she weighted other factors like tracking and disciplinary measures more heavily.</p>

					<p>At this point, we realized that since we couldn’t make assumptions about why the user may have chosen a specific school, we needed to design the final summary content so that it didn’t depend on the user’s interpretation of the situation or their school property prioritizations.  Instead, to make the summary section more relevant and realistic, we would just surface mismatches between equity value statements and inequitable school properties.  We didn’t need to comment on whether or not the user valued a particular school property.</p>

					<strong>2. Balancing schools to ensure a difficult but realistic decision</strong>
					<p>Our interviews with teachers also heavily informed how we balanced school choices.  We had originally designed for each school property to have an equitable, an inequitable, and a neutral option, and we randomly assigned them to the different schools to evenly distribute summary points.  However, we realized that this created unrealistic schools: a small private school is unlikely to have tracking and would probably have high quality support programs for its students.  Talking with teachers allowed us to still distribute school properties evenly to make the decision difficult, but we were able to do this in a way that felt more realistic.  In addition, we continued to adjust language in school properties to make sure schools weren’t immediately eliminated.  For example, we added financial aid information to the private school to prevent it from immediately being cost-prohibitive as a choice.</p>

					<h3>Refining the online product</h3>
					<p>After fine-tuning the content and building out the full online prototype with the summary section, we interviewed <b>eleven users from our target audience</b> – college-aged students who do not have children but may in the future and who would likely have the privilege to choose a school for their child later in life.  For these users, we focused on three different questions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Was the UI difficult to use? (This mostly came through observing and asking them to talk through what they saw/were doing.)</li>
						<li>Did the message about complexity in education equity and the juxtaposition of values for an equitable society with personal school choice implications come across?</li>
						<li>Did the content and message feel relevant to you?</li>
					</ul>
					<strong>1. Explicit introductory instructions</strong>
					<p>A few users noted that the introductory instructions caused some mistrust in the objective of the explorable, with one user calling the language “cryptic” and “stilted.”  Since these feelings were generally compounded in their then being forced to make binary decisions, we updated the instructions to more explicitly prepare the user for picking value statements.  We wanted to make it clear that there were not expected to 100-percent agree with only one of the values and also emphasized that there are no “right” or “wrong” answers.  After making these changes and additionally asking future testers about the clarity of instructions, we did not see mistrust going into the value statement selection task.</p>

					<strong>2. A table for school choice</strong>
					<p>The personal choice section was the most information dense section of our experience and led to design challenges in conveying the information in a digestible but sufficiently informative manner. In many early user tests, we consistently had test users ask for more information about the school (“What is the school size? I could not make a decision without knowing that.” “What are the specifics of the demographic makeups? ‘Majority white’ and ‘majority students of color’ are oversimplified.”) But as we added more and more information, our depiction become more and more difficult to navigate.</p>

					<p>In talking with one user about this issue, she recommended a scrollable comparison table approach, modeled after tables that compare different features of cameras. While not particularly visually appealing, this format is very readable and allows for comparison across different choices easily.</p>

					<p>After switching to this format, we had to make a compromise between continued feedback that presenting all the information was overwhelming and opposing requests for all the information to be presented at once. We decided to keep the single table approach but instead collapsed all school properties but the first using an accordion format.  In this way, users can digest one row of information at a time and are forced to click to actively read and learn more about each trait.</p>

					<strong>3. Back button for reselecting schools</strong>
					<p>In our tests, many people would accidentally click through on school choices or expect that hitting a school button would expand all of the school properties.  After going through the online explorable, users also stated that they were curious to learn more about the other school options and what mismatches in equity those would generate (“I want to do it again”).  To both allow users to undo the click-through mistake, as well as allowing them to learn more by switching schools, we created a back button on the summary page.</p>

					<strong>4. Showing non-mismatches in equity</strong>
					<p>In the summary section of our explorable, we initially only showed content where the user’s equitable values conflicted with their choice of school, largely to constrain information display and to prevent their feeling guilty if their original values were already inequitable. However, we didn’t consider the fact that many users wanted positive feedback – one in particular asked to understand why their school choice was equitable in the properties that weren’t highlighted.  By enabling the school property buttons where mismatches with equitable values weren’t present, we were able to both maximize learning if a user’s original value statement choice was inequitable and also provide positive feedback to users whose values and school choice were equitable in a particular property.  This also ensures that all users, regardless of their value statements, receive informative content about equity and school choice – rather than maximizing content for users with equitable value statements and inequitable school properties.</p>

					<h3>User testimonies</h3>

					<p>Overall, through our user testing we also wanted to make sure that the content felt relevant to our target audience.  In particular, this concern came from the fact that our initial interviews were with teachers – who have already actively been thinking about these issues of equity – and that our in-class demo saw mixed responses around effectiveness.  However, none of our individual user tests indicated that the our target audience members felt disconnected from the content.  In fact, after completing the explorable, several users expressed the understanding of complexity that we wanted to convey:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>“I really cared about the content – that’s why the decision was so hard. By choosing the private school I felt like I was enforcing these issues in education.” - Stanford master’s student who attended a private high school and selected the private school</li>
						<li>“I liked the content.  Definitely very understandable...It made sense <em>for me</em>. [emphasis added]” - USC freshman who attended a private high school and selected the private school</li>
						<li>“It made me appreciate how much more complicated it is to make these decisions.  I kind of have been thinking about – just abstractly – private vs. public and when I have a kid. I came to empathize with people who make decisions on both sides...I think it is relevant...the thing at the end with the values is a really good way to visualize the complexities of the decision.” - Stanford senior who attended a private high school</li>
						<li>“I really like the idea of people seeing how their values and core beliefs relate to the decision they make about education – like wow!  That’s so important.  Y’all got me in the end.”  – Stanford senior</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The explorable prompted another user just out of college to go on what she called a related “rant” about class gaps and class mobility through education and how “liberal [values] inherently contradict the direct incentives of people in power.”</p>

					<p>In general, we found that those who came from more privileged backgrounds and private schools seemed to really resonate with the explorable's message. We suspect that some of the difficulties in audience that arose from our in-class demo also came about from having several people at once input their decisions for value statements and schools, making it more difficult to connect with the choices. In our future work, we want to continue testing the explorable’s effectiveness with our target audience, and for more information about our considerations in specifying our audience, please see <a href="solution.html">Next Steps.</a></p>

					<h4>About the Project</h4>
					<p>For our CS377I course (Designing Systems for Humans) in Spring 2018, we created an explorable explanation about issues in education to promote reflection and awareness of potential misalignment between one’s values and decisions, as they relate to equity.
