<h1>Rockhopper Penguins</h1>
<h3>By: Nancy</h3>

<h2>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWipK8dkxYI">Rockhopper Penguins</a> are creatures that are adorable, smart, and strong. 
Some live in colder climates and are forced to battle storms to get onto land, 
some live in warmer climates but their struggle is just as hard. Rockhoppers will 
eat small fish or mainly krull, such as shrimp, crabs lobsters etc. 
They will also occasionally east a squid or two. Rockhoppers must spend several days 
at sea to catch something, so they have learned to be able to dive 330 ft. for minutes 
while searching for food.

These penguins can live on land without much danger, 
but in the water they are hunted by killer whales, leopard seals, and blue sharks! 
There chicks and eggs are eatikng by varius birds on land. These penguins, 
and other species of penguins are also afected not only by predators of the  sea but also 
by oil spills in the ocean, in 2011 there was an oil spill, which affected many rockhoppers 
in horrible ways.
